<h3>Software</h3>
 
<p>
  For this course you will need the UNIX shell and <a href= "http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a>, or
  <a href= "https://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a>. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.  
</p>

<p>
If you are running <strong>macOS</strong> you should already have SQLite installed. You can run `sqlite3 --version`
in a terminal to confirm that it is available. You can also download DB Browser for SQLite from
  <a href= "https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">their website.</a>  
</p>

<p>
  If you are running <strong>Linux</strong>, you may already have SQLite3 installed, please use the command 
`which sqlite3` to see the path of the program, otherwise you should be able to get it 
from your package manager (on Debian/Ubuntu, you can use the command `apt install sqlite3`).  
</p>
  
<p>
  If you are running <strong>Windows</strong>, run installers as administrator.
Additionally, make sure you select the right installer version for your system.
  We recommend that you use <a href= "https://gitforwindows.org/">git for Windows</a>.
  This is described in the <a href= "http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html">UNIX Shell lesson</a>.
If the installer asks to add the path to the environment variables, check yes, otherwise you have to manually add the path of the executable to the `PATH` environmental variables.
This path informs the system where to find the executable program.  
</p>

<p>
If installing SQLite3 using Anaconda, refer to the [anaconda sqlite docs](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/sqlite).  
</p>

<p>
After the installation and the setting of the paths, close the terminal and reopen a new terminal.
This enables paths and configurations to be loaded.
